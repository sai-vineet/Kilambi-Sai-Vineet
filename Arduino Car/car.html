        <u><h1>How can I make my robot car Bluetooth?</h1></u>
        <p>Arduino Bluetooth control car is a simple robot car that can be controlled by your
            smartphone. This Smartphone gives a Bluetooth signal to the car and from the signal, the
            car works. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For running the car wirelessly we are using the HC-05 Bluetooth module. We connect your
            phone with the BlueTooth module. Then the phone sends some random characters which
            are stated for running the car. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, case, F is used for forwarding car movement.  B is used for a backward car
            moment. Similarly, Other characters are used for other directions which are mentioned in
            the Arduino code. 
        </p>

    <div>
        <u><h1>Make Bluetooth Controlled car using Arduino:</h1></u>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">For controlling the Motors we are using an l298n motor driver.
              you can also use l293d also. 
               I chose l298n in over l293d  because it has high power output. 
            If you are interested in l293d Bluetooth car then make sure you subscribe to our YouTube channel.</p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Now for running the car obviously we need a power source.
             So, For the power source, we are using  18650 Lithium-ion cells. </p>

       <h1>Motor:</h1>
       <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        For the motor section, I am using a TT motor.
         These are some great for our Bluetooth control car project.
          And it has some low voltage range like 3V to 6V.
           So, These Motors are great for DIY projects.
            Here I have also added some high torque Motors well if you want more power. 

        Here, I have used for motors two Motors each site.
         Two side Motors are connected in parallel for high torque. 
         And the two-sided Motors cables will go to the motor driver.
       </p>

       <h1>Motor Driver:</h1>
       <p style="font-size: 25px;">For the motor driver, I am using an l298n  H Bridge motor driver.
            This is some good power output so I am using it. 
           Now just connect two-sided motor cables with the motor driver. </p>
        <h1>
            The main controller  Arduino Uno R3:
        </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            For the controller, I am using a basic Arduino microcontroller i.e. Arduino Uno R3.
             Now used double-sided tape for attaching it on the wood.
             And now I have connected the data warehouse with the l298n motor driver for sending the reader purses which will drive the motor.
        </p>
        <h1>Bluetooth module:</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            For the Bluetooth module, I am using HC 05 Bluetooth module. 
            You can also use an HC-06 Bluetooth module as well.
             For keeping it simple I am using it.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:  25px;">
            Note: You must know that when you are uploading the code to the Arduino.
             You must unplug the RX and TX pin of the Bluetooth module.
             Otherwise, you will not be able to upload the code to the Arduino.</p>

       <h1>Arduino Bluetooth car circuit diagram:</h1>
       <img src="car.jpg" alt="image"> 
             
       <h1>Software/ Coding part:</h1>

       <p>For uploading the code choose the right board. 
            Then choose the write com port and then compile first and then upload to Arduino.
             As simple as that. </p>

        <p>Now install the app in your Android device and then open it and connect it with the Bluetooth HC 05.
             Now you can see the red blinking but will be changed in green.
             So, It means that you are connected with the Bluetooth car robot. </p>
        <p>Next, you can perform the forward-backward  
             Left Right functions and you can see the queries working.</p>
